## Background

​

### An Enigma Machine is one of the most sophisticated encryption machines in the 20th century. It was commonly used during World War II by the German Military to send an encrypted message to one another without the enemies being able to know what the message actually contains. This encryption was then cracked by Allied forces thanks to earlier decryption attempts by Poland under the leadership of mathematician Marian Rejewski in the early 1930s. However, there weren’t any notable developments until Bletchley Park, a secret British intelligence facility, discovered a breakthrough thanks to the Bombe machine, a machine which can decrypt Enigma text faster than it would take an average human 

### Our project aims to recreate the functionality of the Enigma machine using VHDL, a hardware description language used to design and simulate digital systems. VHDL allows us to accurately model the Enigma's rotors and reflectors, as well as its plugboard for additional encryption. By reimplementing the Enigma in VHDL, we hope to gain a better understanding of how it worked and how it was eventually broken.

### In this report, we will provide a detailed overview of our project. We believe that this project not only serves as a valuable educational tool, but also offers insight into the design of historical encryption devices and the challenges involved in breaking them.
